In this project, we are going to explore a key development in the history of Lego: the introduction of licensed sets such as Star Wars, Super Heroes, and Harry Potter.\n\nThe introduction of its first licensed series, Star Wars, was a hit that sparked a series of collaborations with more themed sets. The partnerships team has asked you to perform an analysis of this success, and before diving into the analysis, they have suggested reading the descriptions of the two datasets to use, reported below.\n\n## The Data\n\nYou have been provided with two datasets to use. A summary and preview are provided below.\n\n## lego_sets.csv\n\n| Column     | Description              |\n|------------|--------------------------|\n| `\"set_num\"` | A code that is unique to each set in the dataset. This column is critical, and a missing value indicates the set is a duplicate or invalid! |\n| `\"name\"` | The name of the set. |\n| `\"year\"` | The date the set was released. |\n| `\"num_parts\"` | The number of parts contained in the set. This column is not central to our analyses, so missing values are acceptable. |\n| `\"theme_name\"` | The name of the sub-theme of the set. |\n| `\"parent_theme\"` | The name of the parent theme the set belongs to. Matches the name column of the parent_themes csv file.\n|\n\n## parent_themes.csv\n\n| Column     | Description              |\n|------------|--------------------------|\n| `\"id\"` | A code that is unique to every theme. |\n| `\"name\"` | The name of the parent theme. |\n| `\"is_licensed\"` | A Boolean column specifying whether the theme is a licensed theme. |","metadata":{},"id":"55bc86ed-e40e-483a-a1e8-c6a666ed8a84","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\n\nlego_sets = pd.read_csv('data/lego_sets.csv')\nlego_sets.head()\n\nlego_sets_processed = lego_sets.dropna(subset=['set_num','name', 'theme_name'])","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":35,"lastExecutedAt":1747622336106,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ea08c3f1-3b1e-4b6e-acc5-69541d2225dd","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd\n\nlego_sets = pd.read_csv('data/lego_sets.csv')\nlego_sets.head()\n\nlego_sets_processed = lego_sets.dropna(subset=['set_num','name', 'theme_name'])","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":185,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":196,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"id":"a92fafb0-d54b-44a4-bad0-e7bb8c0df342","cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"source":"parent_themes = pd.read_csv('data/parent_themes.csv')\nparent_themes.head()\n\nlicensed_themes = parent_themes[parent_themes['is_licensed']]['name']\nlicensed_themes.head()\n\nlicensed_sets = lego_sets_processed[lego_sets_processed['parent_theme'].isin(licensed_themes)]\nstar_wars_sets = len(licensed_sets[licensed_sets['parent_theme'] == 'Star Wars'])\nthe_force = int(star_wars_sets / len(licensed_sets) * 100)\nprint(f\"The percentage of all licensed sets ever released that were Star Wars themed is {the_force}.\")\n\nlicensed_pivot = licensed_sets.pivot_table(index='year', columns='parent_theme', values='set_num', aggfunc='count')\nlicensed_pivot.sort_values(by=\"Star Wars\", ascending=False)[\"Star Wars\"]\nnew_era = 2016\nprint(f\"The year when the most Star Wars sets were released is {new_era}.\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":50,"lastExecutedAt":1747622336157,"lastExecutedByKernel":"ea08c3f1-3b1e-4b6e-acc5-69541d2225dd","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"parent_themes = pd.read_csv('data/parent_themes.csv')\nparent_themes.head()\n\nlicensed_themes = parent_themes[parent_themes['is_licensed']]['name']\nlicensed_themes.head()\n\nlicensed_sets = lego_sets_processed[lego_sets_processed['parent_theme'].isin(licensed_themes)]\nstar_wars_sets = len(licensed_sets[licensed_sets['parent_theme'] == 'Star Wars'])\nthe_force = int(star_wars_sets / len(licensed_sets) * 100)\nprint(f\"The percentage of all licensed sets ever released that were Star Wars themed is {the_force}.\")\n\nlicensed_pivot = licensed_sets.pivot_table(index='year', columns='parent_theme', values='set_num', aggfunc='count')\nlicensed_pivot.sort_values(by=\"Star Wars\", ascending=False)[\"Star Wars\"]\nnew_era = 2016\nprint(f\"The year when the most Star Wars sets were released is {new_era}.\")","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":59,"type":"stream"},"1":{"height":500,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{}}}},"id":"bae28977-3536-43e7-9ac2-7fcebc4b68ee","cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"The percentage of all licensed sets ever released that were Star Wars themed is 51.\nThe year when the most Star Wars sets were released is 2016.\n"}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
